Bitcoin Incremental
===================

Simple incremental game prototype I made with Isogenic Engine. 

Consider this project abandoned. I will probably not work on this anymore, but you are free to do anything you want with it. 

What is working
---------------

* Miner placement
* Saving
* Money system

Planned features
----------------

* Buying bigger warehouses
* Currency valuation
* Electricity (bigger miners need more power, need to buy bigger generators, solar panels etc)
